# TXST Baseball Analytics

Welcome to the TXST Baseball Analytics repository! This project aims to provide tools for analyzing and visualizing baseball statistics, specifically focusing on Texas State University baseball. As a senior in computer science and a sports reporter for the University Star, I aim to integrate data into storytelling to enhance sports journalism.

## Background

With the growing importance of data in sports, this repository serves as an open-source platform for anyone interested in baseball analytics. By leveraging data, we can gain insights into player performance, team dynamics, and game outcomes, which can significantly enrich sports reporting.

## Features

- **Calculate Advanced Metrics**: Includes functions to compute metrics like wOBA, wRC, and FIP.
- **Player Lookup**: Easily find player statistics and details.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visual representations of player and team performance.
- **Season Stats**: Retrieve player and team statistics for specific seasons.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pandas` library
- A virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JohanEjiasi/TXST-Baseball-Analytics.git
   cd TXST-Baseball-Analytics
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas requests
   ```

### Usage

To run the analytics scripts, execute the main script:
```bash
python sabermetrics.py
```

This will output the top offensive players based on OPS and can be expanded to include more analyses as you contribute to the project.
